# Catch Your Cat

This project was developed as part of [Ironhack's](https://www.ironhack.com/en) full-time Web Development course.

## The project

_Catch Your Cat_ allows people to find out which cat breed is more suitable to their lifestyle and personal circunstances.

### CAT API

For this project, we made use of the cat api to retrieve all cats' breeds and their relevant information.

### Filter Algorithm

The projects' APISearch component mainly dictates the logic of our matching process.
Users' answers, from "A" to "C", filters out the cat list, being "A" more flexible and "C" more restricted.

### UI

All the User Interface has been developed with REACT

### CRUD

The project's CRUD schema is mainly based on the consumption of data (GET) from the Cat API and full-CRUD from/to a dedicated API which stores users' replies and results.
